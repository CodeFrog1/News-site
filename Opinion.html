                By Spoon Man 
            </h3>

            <p class="Opinion">
                    The earliest use of the spoon came about in ancient 
                Egypt around 1,000 B.C. They were like mini bowls on a stick.<br> They
                were made of wood, ivory, flint and stone. They were also adorned 
                with hieroglyphics and religious symbols.<br> They were utensils owned 
                strictly by Pharohs and dieties and that is where our story starts.<br>

                <br>The spoon saw several design changes throughout the Renaissance and into the 
                18th century. It was then that the<br> modern design, a narrow, elliptical-shaped 
                bowl with a rounded end of the handle, stuck for the centuries that followed.<br>

                <br>This change in spoon design changed the very way spoons could be used forever.
                Starting in the islands of Oceania <br> the new spoon design alowed canibals to more easily
                eat their meat soup and intestine Soufflé with a side of choclate. <br>

                
                <br>In 2014, a Florida man was executed after sitting on Death Row for four decades. Among his crimes? 
                Murdering a prison <br> guard with a spoon in 1980.

                <br><br>In 2004, a man in the UK was acquitted of murder after he struck another man in the back of his head<br>
                with a "dessert spoon." Dessert spoons are even smaller than regular spoons, so the blow had to hit
                a specific spot and have had <br> great force behind it in order to cause the catastrophic damage that it
                did. The coroner determined that the utensil "ruptured an artery <br> and caused fatal bleeding in the area 
                 between [the victim's] skull and brain." 

                <br><br>Clearly the spoon has been used for nefarious purposes for <br>a long  time
                even back in ancient Egypt. With such information I think it is safe to say
                that the spoon should be reclassified from a kitchen <br>utensil to a weapon.

                By Bird scientist chef 
            </h3>

           

            <p class="Opinion">
                The history of Geese go way back to 11,000 years and 4,000 years ago when they
                started spreading<br> to Egypt and becoming demesticated. Most descendence of modern 
                geese come from greylag, a wild <br> goose from northern Eurasia, and the swan goose,
                a wild goose from eastern Asia. Unlike its monogamous<br> wild cousins, domestic geese
                are polygamous and thus more productive for commercial uses.<br>

                <br>With such knowledge in mind let's analyze goose behavior and why they 
                are detramental to the health of society.<br> Canadian geese for example
                will find a good place to eat and live there for years on end such as
                a park. They will <br> eat up to 3 pounds of grass and produce 2 pounds of
                droppings a day that contain dangerous bacteria like  E Coli,<br> salmonella,
                giardia, and more. Besides messing up property for years on end they will 
                honk for hours on end without<br> stop, behave agressivly towards humans and
                other animals, and will tear rodents apart if they get to close to them.<br> 

                <br>There are examples of geese attacking humans on a regular basis. One women      <aside class="Opinion">
                    "The goose came out of no where, attacking me 
                     while I came out of walmart for no reason at all. 
                     Although, now that I think about it might 
                     have been because I killed one of her babies."
                </aside> 
               

                
                </p>

                <p class="Opinion" style="margin-left:10vw;">
                was attcked in a walmart parking lot in Toronto, one man was atcked in <br> central
                park New York, and a child was dragged off by a canadian goose in Ohio.<br>
                
                <br>With such agressive behavior by geese towards human kind
                we can safely say that the only recorse for our survival<br>
                is too kill them off in our parks and sell their meat
                to me, I mean chefs for a profit.
