                    Through varies studies throughout the decade
                video games have been shown to privide unique<br>
                skills to developing children, adolescents,
                and adults. Skills such as eye-hand cordination,<br>
                memorization, reflexes, critical thinking and planning.

                <br><br>Video games nowadays, however, incorporate so much
                of these elements and more to the point<br> that one
                is saturated with constant stimulation. Such
                overstimulation can lead to problems over<br> time
                such as headaches, memory problems, lack of sleep,
                and tough times focusing on other activities. 

                <br><br>That is why depite the outdatedness and supposed "boringness"
                of Pong it is the best game to develop<br> simple skills. Its
                simplicity leads to better speciialized skill development 
                because of how predicatble and<br> repedative the game becomes
                one speciializes in planning, eye-hand cordination and reflexes.
                Such simple<br> skill development can lead one to greater oportunities
                down the road and a foundation for future development.

            <p class="Opinion">
                I used to play the card game Uno with my pet Monkey every evening
                when I was little. It was<br> lots of fun and then after
                a while I played Dos with my pet aligator every morning when 
                I was in <br>high school.

                <aside class="Business">
                    "My pet monkey is the best at Uno!"
                </aside>

                <p style="margin-left:5vw" class="Opinion">
                    <br><br>But I always wondered while playing those game, "Uno is one in spanish
                    and one is the number<br> of cards one has to have to win, same with dos.
                    But what about Unus, the latin word for one, we have<br> Uno but not Unus why not?"

                    <br><br>So I tryed to start my own card game "Unus" when I grew older. It flopped.
                    What conclusion do I come<br> to from all of this? The only reason I can think of as to
                    why there isn't an Unus card game and why myn<br> flopped is because people must Hate 
                    Latin.
