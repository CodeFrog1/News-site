                By Business man 
            </h3>

            <p class="Business">
                Following a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower
                leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's
                plan to rebrand <br> the company and to change its name. In the
                Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed 
                the ongoing criticism of the company's social<br> services and the way
                it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building
                the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name
                change. The<br> metaverse vision and the name change from 
                Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook
                Connect on October 28, 2021. Based on Facebook's<br> PR campaign,
                the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus
                of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical
                world by social media,<br> virtual reality and augmented reality
                features. 

                <br><br>Such rebranding efforts on the part of facebook however doesn't appeal 
                to their current consumers. Of which led many to question facebook's decision
                since they would<br> have to apeal to new consumers of which would be 
                dificult for Meta since they would have to compete with already established
                companies that are already making virutal<br> calaboration, environment and chat rooms.
                
                <br><br>Many economists object to such rebranding efforts since Facebook
                has already been doing so well financially."If they wanted to enter
                into the industry of virtual reality<br> why didn't they just start
                a new company from the ground up as an offbranch of facebook?" One 
                economists says. <br>

                <br>With all their eggs in one basket of virtual reality, their late 
                entry into the industry, and proposing plans alreayd in place in many
                virtual reliaty companies, Meta is doomed<br> to fail through competition 
                and inexperience in an industry many have been in for years.

            <p class="Business">
                After Elon Musk's back and forth relationship with 
                tiwtter on whether he will buy it or not results in a
                final desicion,<br> Elon Musk is going to buy twitter. With 
                concerns of free speech, twitter bots, lazy and corrupt
                employees and board <br>executives him and his team drive down to
                twitter headquarters. With his experience with the backlash of 
                employees<br> and enourmous amounts of twitter bots Elon Musk brings 
                a sink to the headquarters to let the absudaty of his situation<br> 
                "sink in" for poeple.

                <aside class="Business">
                    Earlier, Musk changed his description on the social
                     media service, where he has more than 110 million 
                     followers, to “Chief Twit.”
